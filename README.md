This is a very basic python code which helps predict the returns on a stock. After running the code you have to enter the monthly returns of a stock (in percentage),Amount you want to invest and time(months) for which you are investing and according the past performance of the stock this code will predict the returns you'll get after the given time period. In the end you get a dataframe having three columns - Company Name,Returns,Risk.
